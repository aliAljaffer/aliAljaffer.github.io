# Catus Locatus

## Work In Progress

I'm working on redeploying this project using a different database and hosting provider! It's currently using Supabase for DB and is hosted on Vercel.

## Overview

**Catus Locatus** is a lost pet finding app. Announce a pet you lost by showing others where it was lost. Other people can contact you if they find your pet! All pets are drawn on top of a Leaflet map, with dog/cat emojis for easier searching. The website only accepts coordinates of your current location, to reduce the number of false reports.
