# Teamwork And Collaboration

Publish date: `2025-10-13`

## Overview

Following my team's successful launch of our Project 2 -[End-to-end Fully Automated Three-tier Application hosted on Azure](https://github.com/aliAljaffer/e2e-automated-deployment-azure-app), the instructor was impressed with our collaboration as a team. As the **team's leader** for the project, I was asked by Mr. Saurabh Dhingra, our lead instructor, to prepare a session on the practices we used to achieve such level of collaboration.

A session where I present GitHub concepts that aide and enhance teamwork between team members, like Github Issues, Pull Requests, Branching, Merging Branches, and more.
